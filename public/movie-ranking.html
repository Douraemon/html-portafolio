<h1>The Best Movier Ever According To Douglas</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>It's an obvious option, but I'm never tired of watching this movie. I believe it is the "modern" Citizen Kane.</p>
<h3>The Graduate</h3>
<p>This movie hits me to my very core. I identified a lot with the main character. I feel certain attraction to old women, and I too was lost when I finished High School.</p>
<h3>Amadeus</h3>
<p>I watched this movie every year. The story is amazing, part fictional, part real. The acting of Mozart and Salieri is amazing. Lastly, the music is just perfect.</p>
